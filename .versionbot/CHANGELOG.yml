        Changed references to `master` branch to `main` in alignment with
        GitHub's shift to a new default.


        GitHub repos now default to `main` instead of `master`. When I created a
        new repo which had a default branch of `main` and I used the example
        from the README the workflow didn't trigger because it was pointing to
        `master`. This change amends the README to refer to the new default, and
        changes the example action to trigger on both `master` and `main`
        branches to be backwards compatible. 
         
        See [this article](
        https://www.zdnet.com/article/github-to-replace-master-with-main-starting-next-month/#:~:text=Starting%20next%20month,%20all%20new,them%20with%20more%20inclusive%20terms)
        for changes to GitHub default.

        This saves tons of time during the build stage of the action.

        The downside being we can't use dependabot to bump the CLI version
        automatically.

        It also required a debian base image as the standalone zip requires
        glibc and not musl.

                                        responses that are still accepted

                                        by common browsers.


                                        Always using Z_SYNC_FLUSH is what cURL
                                        does.

                                provided, the backend will auto-increment the

                                revision field of the release. A composite

                                release.version field is also added, which has a
                                raw

                                field with the complete unique version of the

                alternative overload of `getAvailableOsVersions`. As a result,
                the word

                'recommended' is no longer printed next to any OS versions.

                        quite possible that it may stop working entirely in any
                        future release.

    - subject: Refactor build process to use standard lib function Previous method
        used Github exec module which did not pass the SIGINT signal to the
        build process which prevented the CLI from telling the builder to cancel
        if the github action is stopping.
